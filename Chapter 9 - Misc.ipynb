    "In the code above, you can see the with keyword being used. This tells Python that you are opening a file. This way, you don't need to close the file after you are done with it (the file closes as soon as you exit the with block). The open function takes 2 arguments, the first being the relative path of the file (unless you are using a Windows program, in which case, you have to switch over to running with Powershell/CMD) and the second being the mode you are opening the file in. There are basically 3 modes, read, write, and append. You can mix and match some of them, ie. read and write.
