# Learn Coding

This is interactive way to learn how to code. This course goes from the basics as in data types and variables to more complex subjects like functional vs object oriented programming. The bulk of this course will use Python 3.8 as examples. There will also be exercises to attempt at the end of chapters and answers to the exercises at the end of the next chapter

## Requires/Install

If you want to edit this notebook, the following section is for you.



This was made with the Jupyter Notebook (previously known as iPython notebook), therefore, it requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the modules **jupyterlab** and **notebook**.

To start up the Jupyter Notebook, go to the desired directory and enter

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the file and you can now edit the file 



## About Jupyter

Jupyter is a open-source project that supports interactive data. Jupyter can run many different languages and is useful if you want to run programs by parts. More can be found in the following [link](https://jupyter.org/about)
