    "Classes are another way to **encapsulate** code. Classes can be a powerful tool that can make code general. This means being able to migrate code to new projects. To create a class, use the class keyword followed by the name of the class (class names are capitalized). Contained within a class can be attributes (initizialed with the **__init__()** method), functions (called methods), and static attributes (will go into detail later). To **instantiate** a class, simply assign a variable the class name and variables needed for __init__. To call a method, just use the class name dot method name (plus variables the method might require) call method.  "

    "Another very important concept is setter and getter methods. In the example above, **peekBreed** is a getter method and **found_allergies** is a setter. This is because peekBreed returns the breed to the caller and found_allergies sets the allergies. These are here because you cannot directly modify the attributes of the class. If you want to directly change variables belonging to the class outside of the class, you must use **properties**. To do this, just declare a variable in the class but not within a method. "
